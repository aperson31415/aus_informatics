# Various Australian Informatics Resources
ORAC Solutions to AIO problems, AIIO Problems, Alpha Contest Problems, FARIO Problems, Other ORAC Problems. By the way, if a problem file is just a number, it refers to [https://orac2.info/problem/id/](#https://orac2.info/problem/id/). Also, I will not include solutions to leaderboarded-questions (Less than 10 people solved) (so I can stay on the leaderboard), or Selection Exam problems (maybe later tho because I don't want to :) ).

Here is a list of the included problem's solutions:

## ORAC Hidden Problem Revealer
A tool located in the top folder of this repository which, as injected as a userscript, shows some old, hidden orac2.info problems. Note that this doesn't unlock any sets, just some old un-searchable and un-listed problems.

## Advanced AIO Tutorials
This is a project being worked on right now, to cover some advanced AIO problems, and topics needed to solve them. This also extends into AIIO problems and topics. I hope to also make a userscript to integrate this into orac2.info.
